    -- Setup effificent error logging for robust debugging as the project grows in size
    -- Completed maximum part of the Backend server, controllersn middlewares and routes
    -- Added role-based dashboard features (in cacoon phase).

## Day 8 ( 20/06/2025 )

    -- Started working on badges and games for the dashboard
    -- Modified the Folder Structure for easier configuration
    -- Converted the backend files from TypeScript to JavaScript (to make the implementation easier)

## Day 7 ( 19/06/2025 )

    -- Almost completed the backend of the application
    -- Integrated backend with user login and authentication
    -- Updated the config files and Docs
    -- Added Middlewares to secure the application and hadle API calls.

## Day 6 ( 18/06/2025 )

    -- Improved the Schemas of models
    -- Debugged application errors
    -- Redesigned the Database
    -- Sight modifications in App Navigation and Workflow

## Day 5 ( 17/06/2025 )

    -- Updated the User Interface along with Application flow
    -- Made Simple User Registration and Login Pages
    -- Modified the Backend significantly but still now production-ready
    -- Secured routes with JWT Authentication

## Day 4 ( 16/06/2025 )

    -- Built API endpoint and middlewares to safely authenticate the user.
    -- Mock Backend for data retrival and CRUD operations
    -- Modified the Backend significantly but still now production-ready
    -- Sight modifications in App Navigation and Workdflow

## Day 3 ( 13/06/2025 ):

    -- Fully Mobile Responsive Design.
    -- Improved Color Scheme.
    -- Implemented full analytics page with Chart.js on dummy data.
    -- Made simple backend which will be improved in the future.

## Day 2 ( 12/06/2025 ):

    -- Successfully integrated Dark Mode.
    -- Made the design mobile responsive.
    -- Added pages (earlier filled with dummy data), with real data.
    -- Made the Designing more streamlined and fluid

## Day 1 ( 11/06/2025 ):

    -- Today we made our very own Dashboard using React & Tailwind. Our aim make a starting point for adding more features into this project as the days pass by.

    -- Our Dashboard consisted of Navigation Side-Bar, Progress Tracking Plots, Daily Streak Counters, Tasks and much more. For now we have used dummy data but later down the line we will make a dedicated Backend for Data retrieval.

    -- Implemented the basic logical code snippet for User authentication using Json Web Token (althogh it is not compete yet)

    -- Implemented a simple ChatBot which can later be trained to help student with learning

## Current Status

This project is in active development. Currently, the application uses dummy data for demonstration purposes. Future iterations will include:

    - Complete user authentication and authorization
    - Backend integration for data persistence
    - Enhanced analytics features
    - Expanded evaluation tools

## Next Steps
